# you have to change the nest to originalnest becuase in dispalced there is a originalnest but in transfer they might not be...
# basically, I need to make sure that these  functions work for any combination of experiments, wihch might mean that I need to rethink what should be missing and what should not, or maybe have different summary functions for diffeent experiments
# find more bad runs and say what's wrong with them
